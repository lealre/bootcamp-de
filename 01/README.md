# Day 01

This Python script calculates the employee's bonus using their salary and a specified bonus amount. 

#### How it works
---------------------------
1. Both salary and the bonus amount are provided for the user
2. The script then performs the following calculation to determine the bonus value:

    $\text{bonus value} = 1000 + (\text{salary} \times \text{bonus amount})$

3. The script displays the name of the user and the bonus value.
