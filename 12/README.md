# Day 12 - Introduction to Classes

The objective is to create a Python class to hendle differents methods for a CSV file.

### Notes
Recursion in Python, whether in classes or functions, refers to the technique where a function or method calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. This technique is widely used in programming when a problem can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems.

In the context of classes, recursion typically involves methods calling themselves.
