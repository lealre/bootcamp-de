# Day 05 - Project 01 - Data Processing Challenge Using Python

This is the first bootcamp project, where the objective is to process one billion rows using differents python librires and compare the times each one of them spent.

The objective is to clone [this repository](https://github.com/lvgalvao/One-Billion-Row-Challenge-Python) and make script changes based on what we saw in previous bootcamp classes.  

A specific repository was created for this class (link).
