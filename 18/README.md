# Day 18 - What is an API? Request, Pydantic and creating our CRUD

The objective is to create a script that randomly selects a Pokemon ID from the Pokemon API every 10 seconds and stores its respective name and type in the database. 

The script follows the MVC (Model, View, Controller) structure.

### Notes
- [MVC concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller).
