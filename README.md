# BOOTCAMP Data Engineering

In this repository, I am applying the concepts taught in the [Data Engineering Bootcamp](https://github.com/lvgalvao/data-engineering-roadmap/tree/main/bootcamp) by [Luciano Galv√£o](https://github.com/lvgalvao). The Bootcamp consists of 40 classes, and the folder numbers represent the corresponding class numbers. For some classes, a new repository will be created, and the REAME.md will contain the redirect link.
