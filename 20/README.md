# Day 20 -  Project 02 - CRUD with FastApi, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL and Streamlit

This is the second and final bootcamp project, where the objective is to create a web app that can Create, Read, Update, and Delete data from a specific table in a Database.

For this project, I chose to create a catalog of rental properties.
