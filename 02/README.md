# Day 02 - TypeError, Type Check, Type Conversion, try-except and if

The objective is to improve the script that we did on Day 01, dealing with potential inputs provided by the user that can cause problems in KPI calculation.

Some examples of potential problems:

* User gives a number in the name.
* User input in salary is not a number.
